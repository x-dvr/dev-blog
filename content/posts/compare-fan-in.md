## What it is all about?

Fan-in is a pretty common concurrency pattern in Go	often used to aggregate results from multiple goroutines. For example, when implementing a worker pool to process jobs concurrently, fan-in can used to collect results from all workers into a single channel. Or imagine you are writing a system to aggregate logs or metrics from different sources. Out of the box Go provides all needed instruments to easily build fan-in implementation. What we effectively need to do is to write a function to merge several channels into one.

The most standard implementation can look like:
```go {linenos=true}
func Merge[T any](chans ...<-chan T) <-chan T {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	wg.Add(len(chans))

	outCh := make(chan T)
	for _, ch := range chans {
		go func() {
			defer wg.Done()
			for val := range ch {
				outCh <- val
			}
		}()
	}

	go func() {
		wg.Wait()
		close(outCh)
	}()

	return outCh
}

```

Here we create one goroutine per channel to read values from it until it is closed. And we use `sync.WaitGroup` to close the output channel safely after all goroutines are finished. This code looks clean, idiomatic, and works quite efficiently â€” but I just can't resist the urge to explore whether there's faster or more efficient implementation ðŸ™‚.

## In the search of most optimal implementation  

Let's start by drafting a simple case with three input channels. In this case we only need one `select` statement:

```go {linenos=true}
func MergeThree[T any](ch1 <-chan T, ch2 <-chan T, ch3 <-chan T) <-chan T {
	outCh := make(chan T)
	open1, open2, open3 := true, true, true

	go func() {
		for open1 || open2 || open3 {
			select {
			case val, ok := <-ch1:
				if ok {
					outCh <- val
				} else {
					open1 = false
				}
			case val, ok := <-ch2:
				if ok {
					outCh <- val
				} else {
					open2 = false
				}
			case val, ok := <-ch3:
				if ok {
					outCh <- val
				} else {
					open3 = false
				}
			}
		}
		close(outCh)
	}()

	return outCh
}
```



## Outro

This article is already quite big, so I stop here for now. In the next article we will start working on containerization and scalability.
